# Trainer information

Thank you for taking time to support the whiteboard design sessions as a trainer!

## Role of the trainer

An amazing trainer:

-   Creates a safe environment in which learning can take place.

-   Stimulates the participant's thinking.

-   Involves the participant in the learning process.

-   Manages the learning process (on time, on topic, and adjusting to benefit participants).

-   Ensures individual participant accountability.

-   Ties it all together for the participant.

-   Provides insight and experience to the learning process.

-   Effectively leads the whiteboard design session discussion.

-   Monitors quality and appropriateness of participant deliverables.

-   Effectively leads the feedback process.

## Whiteboard design session flow 

Each whiteboard design session uses the following flow:

**Step 1: Review the customer case study (15 minutes)**

**Outcome**

Analyze your customer's needs.

-   Customer's background, situation, needs and technical requirements

-   Current customer infrastructure and architecture

-   Potential issues, objectives and blockers

**Step 2: Design a proof of concept solution (60 minutes)**

**Outcome**

Design a solution and prepare to present the solution to the target customer audience in a 15-minute chalk-talk format.

-   Determine your target customer audience.

-   Determine customer's business needs to address your solution.

-   Design and diagram your solution.

-   Prepare to present your solution.

**Step 3: Present the solution (30 minutes)**

**Outcome**

Present solution to your customer:

-   Present solution

-   Respond to customer objections

-   Receive feedback

**Wrap-up (15 minutes)**

-   Review preferred solution

## Before the whiteboard design session: How to prepare

Before conducting your first whiteboard design session:

-   Read the Student guide (including the case study) and Trainer guide.

-   Become familiar with all key points and activities.

-   Plan the point you want to stress, which questions you want to drive, transitions, and be ready to answer questions.

-   Prior to the whiteboard design session, discuss the case study to pick up more ideas.

-   Make notes for later.

## During the whiteboard design session: Tips for an effective whiteboard design session

**Refer to the Trainer guide** to stay on track and observe the timings.

**Do not expect to memorize every detail** of the whiteboard design session.

When participants are doing activities, you can **look ahead to refresh your memory**.

-   **Adjust activity and whiteboard design session pace** as needed to allow time for presenting, feedback, and sharing.

-   **Add examples, points, and stories** from your own experience. Think about stories you can share that help you make your points clearly and effectively.

-   **Consider creating a "parking lot"** to record issues or questions raised that are outside the scope of the whiteboard design session or can be answered later. Decide how you will address these issues, so you can acknowledge them without being derailed by them.

***Have fun**! Encourage participants to have fun and share!*

**Involve your participants.** Talk and share your knowledge but always involve your participants, even while you are the one speaking.

**Ask questions** and get them to share to fully involve your group in the learning process.

**Ask first**, whenever possible. Before launching into a topic, learn your audience's opinions about it and experiences with it. Asking first enables you to assess their level of knowledge and experience, and leaves them more open to what you are presenting.

**Wait for responses**. If you ask a question such as, "What's your experience with (fill in the blank)?" then wait. Do not be afraid of a little silence. If you leap into the silence, your participants will feel you are not serious about involving them and will become passive. Give participants a chance to think, and if no one answers, patiently ask again. You will usually get a response.

# Azure Blockchain whiteboard design session student guide

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this Whiteboard design session, you will work with a group to learn how to build and configure an Internet of Things (IoT) Audit Solution using Azure blockchain services. You will collect device telemetry using Azure IoT Hub and use Ethereum blockchain ledger to enforce contract specifics related to conditions during transport of goods. Specifically, the IoT devices will report temperature and humidity data that will be validated through the Smart Contracts against agreed upon acceptable ranges.

At the end of this session, you will be able to deploy and configure Azure Blockchain Workbench, write and deploy Ethereum Smart Contracts with Solidity, and integrate both IoT and the blockchain ledger into a single solution.

## Step 1: Review the customer case study

**Outcome**

Analyze your customer's needs.

Timeframe: 15 minutes

Directions: With all participants in the session, the facilitator/SME presents an overview of the customer case study along with technical tips.

1.  Meet your table participants and trainer.

2.  Read all of the directions for steps 1-3 in the student guide.

3.  As a table team, review the following customer case study.

### Customer situation

Northwind Traders is the world's largest food and beverage company. The company has a long history of innovation since its founding more than 150 years ago. Over the last few years, Northwind has been increasing their emphasis on tracking their products from the origin of the raw materials all way through the manufacturing process to the consumer. They pride themselves on being able to certify both the origin and delivery of their products with high accuracy.

With multiple shipping companies and methods, from trucks, to trains, to ships, it is very difficult to guarantee traceability and accuracy of the shipping data. It is also very difficult to avoid inefficiencies and profit losses. The CEO of Northwind Traders, John Adams, states, "The solution to guaranteeing the quality of our products health is complete control of the supply chain."

Coordinating the traceability and accuracy of shipping information across the supply chain is a complex task that requires cooperation and coordination between many different companies and government organizations. Northwind Traders has spent a lot of resources and money to guarantee the accuracy of this data over the years, as well as the security and privacy of the data. Over the years this has required the coordination across languages, and political boundaries, in addition to the efforts of the many different companies involved.

Jill Anders, the CTO of Northwind Traders has reached out to you to help them build a truly innovative solution to better track their shipments. Jill says, "We need a system that is more secure, more efficient, and will help us lower, not just IT costs, but other costs across the organization." They've heard of Blockchain and Smart Contract technologies and are thinking these may help them solve this problem.

As the most innovative company in their industry, they do implement Internet of Things (IoT) devices to track product storage and shipment. They do this mostly using temperature and humidity sensors mounted within warehouses and shipping containers. While this is something that's easy to implement on Northwind Traders properties, it can be difficult to implement across all shipping partners, distributors, and other entities involved. They are looking to additionally integrate these IoT Sensors into their entire supply chain tracking to better increase the level of transparency and traceability of shipping data.

The Northwind Traders engineering team is currently working on adding additional sensor support to the IoT tracking devices they are planning to deploy in the near future. With tracking shipments, a key feature they are working on is the addition of GPS (Global Positioning System) sensors to better enable them to track package locations in real-time. They are also looking to augment some of their IoT devices with Cellular-based Internet connectivity, in addition to Wi-Fi.

Regarding better transparency and traceability of their products, as well as origin materials, the CEO of Northwind Traders, says "I wish we could better track the environment information while our shipments are in the hands of Customs and other Government organizations. It would also help to have a better view into our resellers too." The overall tracking of shipments is a major concern for the company. They want to better track shipments, not just for insurance and quality control reasons, but also so they can better guarantee where supplies are and who's handling them as they flow through the system from raw material to final product sold to consumers.

### Customer needs

1. A more seamless system is needed to manage the supply chain, all the way from farmer to consumer.

2. Easy audit transparency is an important feature, as Northwind Traders needs to coordinate with Customs and other political organizations with ease.

3. The system needs to have immutability of data built as a core feature, to prevent fraud, intentional or otherwise, by partners and third-parties. This will ease audits for regulatory and insurance needs.

4. The Blockchain implementation needs to be secure and fully under the control of Northwind Traders; while simultaneously integrating with partners and third-parties when managing the supply chain.

5. Both new and existing IoT device sensors need to be integrated to ensure the highest quality shipping conditions are maintained; in addition to tracking locations as necessary.

### Customer objections

1. There's a lot of popular interest in Blockchain, and we only understand enough to know it could be useful. We heard it's extremely expensive to implement and/or built a POC (Proof of Concept) solution. Is this true?

2. We've heard Azure Blockchain Workbench uses the Ethereum cryptocurrency. This really doesn't seem like the secure solution we need if our data will be out on the public Ethereum blockchain that anyone can access.

3. When adopting Blockchain and Smart contract technologies, what does the learning curve look like for your development team?

4. How are user accounts or Blockchain wallets managed within Azure Blockchain Workbench? We really need to make sure we have complete control over the security of the entire system.

5. We will have a mixture of IoT devices connecting to the network over either Wi-Fi or Cellular connections. Will it be an issue to integrate these devices and their sensor data with Azure Blockchain Workbench?

6. Is Azure AD really needed? We already have another directory service solution in place. We can't change it simply because we want to leverage Blockchain!

## Preferred target audience

- John Adams, CEO
- Jill Anders, CTO

## Preferred solution

There are two aspects to the final solutions for Northwind Traders. There is the Blockchain Solution, and the IoT Solution to connect all the IoT devices. These two aspects will be connected and integrated to form the full "IoT + Blockchain" solution that will fulfill the stated requirements of the Northwind Traders supply chain needs.

**Design the Blockchain Solution**

1. What Azure services are to be used to build the Blockchain solution?

    To more easily implement the Blockchain solution, the solution will use Azure Blockchain Workbench to create the initial POC (Proof of Concept). After the POC is built out, the solution can be customized to better fit the customers branding and unique requirements.

    The solution built out by the Azure Blockchain Workbench incorporates the following Azure services:

    - Azure App Service Web App
    
    - Azure Application Insights
    
    - Azure Service Bus
    
    - Azure Key Vault
    
    - Azure Virtual Network
    
    - Virtual Machine Scale Set
    
    - Azure Load Balancer
    
    - Azure SQL Database
    
    - Azure Storage

2. What Blockchain technologies will be used for the Blockchain ledger and Smart Contracts?

    The Blockchain technologies used with the default deployment of the Azure Blockchain Workbench are:

    - Ethereum blockchain ledger

    - Smart Contracts written in the Solidity language

3. Come up with a high-level architecture design for the Blockchain solution that meets all the customers' needs.

    The Azure Blockchain Workbench is a POC (Proof of Concept) accelerator. The Workbench is based on an ARM Template that deploys a Blockchain ledger into an Azure Subscription, along with the relevant Azure services needed to build a POC application, packaged with a sample Web / Mobile UI. The generated application includes a web application, REST API, off-chain storage, document processing, as well as additional features. The Azure Blockchain Workbench tool is meant to reduce the amount of time it takes to build out a Blockchain solution; rather than spend a lot of time on Infrastructure, customers can focus more on writing Smart Contracts and customizing the system.

    The Security of the Azure Blockchain Workbench solution is managed by the integration of Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and Azure Key Vault. All user accounts and credentials are managed within Azure AD. When those users authenticate with the Web / Mobile UI applications, Azure AD is integrated as the authentication authority; rather than custom building an authentication solution within the application to provide greater security.

    _For additional information, reference the following **Azure Blockchain Workbench Architecture diagram**._

**Azure Blockchain Workbench Architecture diagram**

![Azure Blockchain Architecutre diagram](images/image4.png "Azure Blockchain Architecture diagram")

Here are some notes to reference about the architecture of the Azure Blockchain Workbench architecture:

- The different tiers of Virtual Machines within the solution are deployed using Virtual Machine Scale Sets to improve scalability to handle load. The infrastructure also uses multiple Virtual Networks to host the different tiers of the system with multiple Network Security Groups applied.

- The Azure SQL Database and Azure Storage Account are both used for off-chain storage to make it easier for BI (Business Intelligence) reporting and other integrations easier to implement.

- The Azure Service Bus is used to more easily support integration with additional applications or systems to extend functionality of the solution.

The workflow of tracking packages throughout the supply chain is implemented by custom Smart Contracts built on top of the Ethereum blockchain ledger. The Blockchain enables an immutable store that prevents fraud, and other causes of data corruption. The workflow and compliance enforcement is implemented by writing Smart Contracts authored with the Solidity programming language. Once the Smart Contract is created and deployed for a Contract, it can be guaranteed that the compliance and possession by Counterparties of packages is maintained. The Smart Contracts also enable the Blockchain network to verify and enforce the compliance requirements in a more automated fashion, while also creating a single system for all shipping partners to participate and cooperate through.

**Design the IoT (Internet of Things) device and sensor integration**

1. What Azure services are to be used to integrate the IoT devices / sensors with the Blockchain solution?

    The IoT (Internet of Things) devices Northwind Traders are working on will have either Cellular or Wi-Fi connectivity to the Internet, or even both. This will enable the devices to easily be integrated with Microsoft Azure IoT Hub and other Azure services.

    These are the Azure services that will be used to implement the IoT aspects of the solution:

    - Azure IoT Hub

    - Azure Stream Analytics

    - Azure Service Bus

    - Azure Logic Apps

    Azure IoT Hub and other services used to implement the IoT aspects of the solution will be integrated with the Azure Blockchain Workbench solution by using the Blockchain Workbench's Service Bus instance as the front-door to both integration and customization. Outside of this, the IoT part of the solution will be implemented as a somewhat "traditional" cloud-based IoT solution using a Lambda Architecture design.

    The use of Azure IoT Hub will enable the sensor and device telemetry to be sent to the cloud and integrated into the full solution. Another set of features that Azure IoT Hub offers is the ability to manage billions of devices individually in a completely secure manner, as well as 2-way device communication with the devices. With 2-way communication they will be able to build a solution that can read sensor / telemetry data, and send command-and-control messaged back down to specific devices as necessary. Overall, Azure IoT Hub will provide the capabilities to build a full IoT solution to more easily manage, deploy, and maintain the large number of IoT devices that will be deployed out to the supplychain.

2. What IoT device telemetry and sensor readings will be integrated to enforcing compliance using the Blockchain Smart Contracts?

    This solution will enable full customizability of the IoT aspects that are required, while simultaneously enabling it to be fully integrated with the Blockchain solution as necessary. Northwind Traders can easily integrate all their sensors into their devices, and then feed the sensor readings into the Blockchain Smart Contracts for compliance enforcement, in addition to other package tracking and monitoring they desire.

    The IoT device sensor data that is planned to be used for enforcing compliance using the Blockchain Smart Contracts, at a minimum, are:

    - Temperature

    - Humidity

    Northwind Traders engineering team will also be able to integrate additional sensors into their devices to track additional telemetry information. They could whether to use this additional telemetry in the implementation of Smart Contracts, or to just simply track this additional data added audit and reporting capabilities. The overall system will be fairly flexible to what they can do with additional device telemetry.

    Here's a list of some additional device telemetry and sensor data that could be integrated into their IoT devices. Some of which they already mentioned may be added, as well as a few other examples of what could be done:

    - GPS sensor to track location via Latitude / Longitude

    - Barometric Pressure

    - Motion / Gyroscope

    - Power status and Battery charge percentage

**Azure IoT + Blockchain Integration Architecture diagram**

![Diagram of the solution architecture showing the major components and Azure services used to build the solution](images/image5.png "Diagram of the solution architecture showing the major components and Azure services used to build the solution")

The integration of the IoT devices into the Azure Blockchain Workbench solution will use the following workflow:

1. A device communicates directly or via a field gateway to IoT Hub.

2. Azure Stream Analytics receives the device messages from IoT Hub, and evaluates the messages.

3. Azure Stream Analytics then sends the messages to Azure Service Bus.

4. A Logic App or other custom code retrieves and transforms the message to a known format.

5. The transformed message, now in a standard format, is sent to the Azure Service Bus for Azure Blockchain Workbench.

6. Azure Blockchain Workbench is subscribed to events from the Service Bus, and retrieves the message.

7. Azure Blockchain Workbench initiates a call to the ledger, sending data from the external system to a specific contract.

8. Upon receipt of the message, the contract evaluates the data and may change the state based on the outcome of the evaluation, for example, for a high temperature, change the state to ‘Out of Compliance’.

## Checklist of preferred objection handling

1. There's a lot of popular interest in Blockchain, and we only understand enough to know it could be useful. We heard it's extremely expensive to implement and/or built a POC (Proof of Concept) solution. Is this true?

    **Answer:**

    Many customers have shared with us that Blockchain proof of concepts can often run around $300K and take 8-12 weeks to build; with the majority of development time and resourcing focused on scaffolding the underlying cloud services.

    With Azure Blockchain Workbench, Microsoft has already done all the heavy lifting. Not only are all the relevant Azure services deployed to your Azure Subscription with an ARM Template, but they are automatically stitched together and offer a simple to use presentation layer. This allows customers to model their workflows and quickly demonstrate value to both business and technical decision makers. And, the Blockchain Workbench only takes about 1 hour to initially deploy.

2. We've heard Azure Blockchain Workbench uses the Ethereum cryptocurrency. This really doesn't seem like the secure solution we need if our data will be out on the public Ethereum blockchain that anyone can access.

    **Answer:**

    By default the Azure Blockchain Workbench does use the Ethereum blockchain ledger. However, it implements your own private instance of an Ethereum powered Blockchain network that you completely control. While you are using the same Blockchain technology that powers the Ethereum cryptocurrency, your Workbench instance is a separate, secure, private instance that your organization controls.

3. When adopting Blockchain and Smart contract technologies, what does the learning curve look like for your development team?

    **Answer:**

    With Azure Blockchain Workbench, the Smart Contracts are written using a language called Solidity. The Solidity language syntax was developed to be similar to C++ and JavaScript language syntax. This helps keep the Solidity language syntax familiar to most existing developers who are already familiar with these other C-style syntax languages.

    Related, the Blockchain Workbench uses an "off-chain" store built with Azure SQL Database. This enables organizations to leverage existing skills and tools to integrate additional capabilities.

4. How are user accounts or Blockchain wallets managed within Azure Blockchain Workbench? We really need to make sure we have complete control over the security of the entire system.

    **Answer:**

    One of the components that are setup with Azure Blockchain Workbench at the time of provisioning is the integration of Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). This enables the system to utilize and rely on Azure AD for the management of all the users and their passwords for authenticating and accessing the Azure Blockchain Workbench presentation layers.

5. We will have a mixture of IoT devices connecting to the network over either Wi-Fi or Cellular connections. Will it be an issue to integrate these devices and their sensor data with Azure Blockchain Workbench?

    **Answer:**

    The Azure IoT Suite encompasses a number services offered for building IoT (Internet of Things) solutions in the Azure cloud. Most notably, the Azure IoT Hub can be used to both easily integrate and fully manage billions of IoT devices. The Azure Stream Analytics services can also be used to easily implement a Lambda Architecture to support both real-time processing, and batch processing of the IoT data stream flowing into the system.

    To integrate the IoT sensor data with the Azure Blockchain Workbench instance, the IoT data stream can flow through to Workbench by integrating with the Azure Blockchain Workbench's instance of Azure Service Bus. This will enable the sensor event data to be sent from the IoT devices into Azure Blockchain Workbench so it can be validated with the appropriate Blockchain Smart Contract.

6. Is Azure AD really needed? We already have another directory service solution in place. We can't change it simply because we want to leverage Blockchain!

    **Answer:**

    The PoC (Proof of Concept) level of using Azure Blockchain Workbench integrates with Azure AD as the preferred choice of handling identity and authentication. However, if you do need another solution to be implemented, the architecture can be integrated with other existing ID management solutions when necessary.
